console.log('HELLO')

// PSUEDO CODE
    // Grab value/info that the user entered in the form/input
    // Create a function that encodes
        // IDEAS:
        // Create an object that defines the alphabet
        // use split() to break the string up into individual characters (need to make sure order is maintained)
        // Look up the index/position that the original letter is at (maybe using indexOf())
        // function will take the index and add 5 to it and return the letter at that index (index + 5)
        // loop through each character/letter in the string and append to the page 
            // Maybe use .map since it returns a new array and we can store it in a variable and append that variable to the page
    // Need to make sure that the function goes back to the beginning of the alphabet if it hits the last index number
        // how?
